    "correct_answer": "All pollutant levels exceeded the WHO air quality guidelines",
    "explanation": "In the EPA 2021 air quality report, all pollutant levels in Ireland exceeded the WHO air quality guidelines. The WHO Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs) are designed to protect public health by offering recommendations for limiting levels of key air pollutants. Updated in 2021, these guidelines provide new, lower threshold values for pollutants based on recent scientific evidence showing the adverse health effects of air pollution at lower concentrations than previously understood. The pollutants covered include particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). The aim is to assist governments and organizations in establishing legal standards and effective measures for reducing emissions and concentrations of these pollutants to improve public health",
