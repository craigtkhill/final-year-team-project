    "question": "Particulate Matter (also called PM) is a particle (solid) air pollutant mainly produced by solid fuel burning. PM particles are very small. How many times smaller than a human hair is PM?",
    "incorrect_answers": ["1 times smaller", "100 times smaller"],
    "correct_answer": "5 times smaller and 20 times smaller",
    "explanation": "The size of PM depends on the width of the particle, which is measured in microns (1 metre = 1 million microns). A human hair is around 50-70 microns in width. PM10 (particles up to 10 micrometers) which includes dust, pollen, and mold, and PM2.5 (particles up to 2.5 micrometers), produced from combustion processes.",

    "question": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a poisonous gas that can cause asthma, respiratory infections, and even poor cognitive health. Which of the following actions is the most effective to reduce NO2 levels and protect health?",
    "incorrect_answers": [
      "Supporting better building energy efficiency through home retrofits",
      "Wearing masks when the air quality is poor"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Reducing the use of motor cars for short journeys in our cities and Avoiding engine idling when parked outside buildings",
    "explanation": "Reducing the use of motor cars and avoiding engine idling are two key actions to limit levels of NO2, as this is mainly caused by car fumes and emissions. Home retrofits are very important to make homes warmer and rely less on solid fuel burning for home heating. Wearing masks is a good way to protect yourself from dirty air, but it does not help to reduce air pollution.",

      "They increase biodiversity"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "They absorb and trap pollutants from the surrounding air",
    "explanation": "Plants absorb and digest gas pollutants such as NO2 as a nutrient. Solid pollutants such as PM stick to the tree leaves and trunk and are then washed away by rain. The other options are all true about plants, although they contribute less (or not at all) to keep the air clean.",
