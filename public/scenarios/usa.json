    {
      "id": 1,
      "text": "Encourage the use of wood as the primary fuel for heating and cooking in new settlements.",
      "consequence": "This choice leads to widespread deforestation, reducing carbon sequestration capabilities of forests and contributing to increased carbon emissions and air pollution."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Advocate for the establishment of community gardens and orchards to supply food locally.",
      "consequence": "Promoting local agriculture minimizes the need for land clearing and reduces carbon emissions from transportation, leading to better air quality and community health."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "text": "Support the expansion of fur trading with indigenous peoples.",
      "consequence": "While fur trading boosts economic growth, it also leads to overhunting and ecosystem imbalances, indirectly affecting air quality through changes in vegetation and habitat."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "text": "Promote the use of horse-drawn carriages and canal boats instead of relying solely on human labor.",
      "consequence": "This reduces the reliance on burning wood for energy in manufacturing and transportation, indirectly decreasing air pollution by conserving forests that act as carbon sinks."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "text": "Introduce legislation for the sustainable management of forests and wildlife.",
      "consequence": "This forward-thinking action helps preserve natural habitats, maintains biodiversity, and ensures forests continue to act as vital carbon sinks, improving air quality and combating climate change."
